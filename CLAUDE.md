# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal repository called "papa-web" that currently contains only a README.md file. The project appears to be in its initial state with no source code, configuration files, or build system yet implemented.

## Current State

- Empty repository with only basic README
- No package.json, build tools, or dependencies configured
- No source code or application structure present
- Clean git repository with initial commit only

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, development commands and build processes have not yet been established. When implementing the web application, typical commands might include:

- Package installation and dependency management
- Development server startup
- Build and deployment processes
- Testing framework setup

The specific toolchain and commands will depend on the technology stack chosen during implementation.
